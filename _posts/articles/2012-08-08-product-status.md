# In progress

## One-click submit design, P&P, UI
 - As a user, I want to select a wizard answer with one click so that I can see results quicker.  
 - We want to speed up the use of the wizard/make it feel faster. This feature should eliminate an extra click on panels with multiple choice questions.
